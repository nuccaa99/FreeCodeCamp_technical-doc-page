        <p>Our CSS Learning Area features multiple modules that teach CSS from the ground up — no previous knowledge
            required.</p>
        <p>CSS first steps</p>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color,
            size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative
            features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it
            works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>
        <p>CSS building blocks</p>
        <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and
            its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks
            at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds
            and borders, debugging, and lots more.
            The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
            essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.</p>
        <p>Styling text</p>
        <code>return number * number;</code>
        <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text —
            one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including
            setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round
            off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.</p>
        <p>CSS layout</p>
        <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate
            the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place
            in relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now
            dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS
            grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.</p>
        <code>return number + number;</code>
        <code>return number - number;</code>
        <p>Use CSS to solve common problems</p>
        <p>This module provides links to sections of content explaining how to use CSS to solve common problems when
            creating a web page.</p>
